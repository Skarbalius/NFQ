# NFQ
 
1. On first visit a teacher should create a new project by providing a title of the project and
a number of groups that will participate in the project and a maximum number of
students per group. Groups should be automatically initialized when a project is created.

*Validated all required fields by checking if they are not empty and matched required data type
*Decided to initialise the groups by a simple FOR loop with SQL query inside. Alternative would have required a trigger but I decided to keep this solution simple.
